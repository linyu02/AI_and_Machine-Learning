ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Projects

A collection of machine learning and deep learning projects from my University of Chicago coursework. Projects range from implementing algorithms from scratch to strengthen mathematical and coding intuition, to applying modern methods in computational biology.

ðŸ”¹ Contents

- Machine Learning Mindmaps â€” concise summaries of core ML concepts and derivations.

- Clustering â€” k-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (EM) implemented from scratch on toy datasets.

- Classification Algorithms â€” classic linear methods such as the Perceptron.

- Neural Networks â€” feedforward network and an LSTM (PyTorch) for next-word prediction on story text.

- Gaussian Processes â€” nonparametric Bayesian models for classification and regression.

- Deep Learning & Unsupervised Learning in Biology â€” applications to gene-expression data, including feature extraction, clustering, and predictive modeling.

ðŸ’¡ Taken together, these projects reflect the kinds of skills that matter in data science. They show I can code up algorithms from scratch to really understand how they work, apply supervised and unsupervised learning on real datasets, use probabilistic models to think about uncertainty, and even work with domain-specific data like gene expression. More importantly, they highlight the ability to move from theory to practice â€” turning data and models into insights.
