ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Projects

A collection of machine learning and deep learning projects from my University of Chicago coursework. Projects range from implementing algorithms from scratch to strengthen mathematical and coding intuition, to applying modern methods in computational biology.

ðŸ”¹ Contents

- Machine Learning Mindmaps â€” concise summaries of core ML concepts and derivations.

- Clustering â€” k-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (EM) implemented from scratch on toy datasets.

- Classification Algorithms â€” classic linear methods such as the Perceptron.

- Neural Networks â€” feedforward network and an LSTM (PyTorch) for next-word prediction on story text.

- Gaussian Processes â€” nonparametric Bayesian models for classification and regression.

- Deep Learning & Unsupervised Learning in Biology â€” applications to gene-expression data, including feature extraction, clustering, and predictive modeling.
