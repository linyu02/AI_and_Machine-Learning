ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Projects

This repository collects machine learning and deep learning projects from my coursework at the University of Chicago. Several projects implement algorithms from scratch (minimal libraries) to deepen mathematical and implementation intuition, while others (from computational biology) apply modern libraries to genetics/gene-expression problems.

ðŸ”¹ Contents

- Theoretical Notes â€” concise summaries of core ML concepts and derivations.

- Clustering

 k-Means and Mixture of Gaussians (EM) implemented from scratch on toy datasets.

- Classification Algorithms
  classic linear methods (e.g., Perceptron).

- Neural Networks
 LSTM (PyTorch) for next-word prediction on story text:

- Gaussian Processes
  nonparametric Bayesian models (classification/regression).

- Deep Learning & Unsupervised in Biology 
applications to gene expression (feature extraction, clustering, and predictive modeling).
